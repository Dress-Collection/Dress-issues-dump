# [\#693 Issue](https://github.com/komeiji-satori/Dress/issues/693) `open`: Raise awareness and prevent StackOverflow from being bought by Microsoft.  

#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2019-10-20 16:14](https://github.com/komeiji-satori/Dress/issues/693):

Today, is a sad day. We've almost lost our rights to have even a small piece of privacy. Once again, in the world, controlled by giant corporations like Microsoft, another community created by us, was taken away. Today, Microsoft has bought StackOverflow and all StackExchange sites. We must unite as never before. For those who believe and for those who don't, for those who resist and for those who gave up, for those who unable to watch Winnie the Pooh in theirs country and for those who still can: we won't let this happen. They think they can stop open source by buying it? We'll make them think again! 

As long as this repository exist, we will fight back! @komeiji-satori let us claim this repository as a place for git-learners and as a basement for conspiracy and coordination our strikes against Microsoft.

You sold your soul on your own, but you still able to resist! Do not let them take your code from you.

what exactly is not beginner friendly in stackoverflow? The fact you have to research your question and try to solve it by yourself before actually asking it?

They’ve sent it to the Stack Overflow email address? I didn’t get such an email when Microsoft bought GitHub (which you are using right now). I’d double check your sources.

If by 'not beginner friendly' you've meant community which will ignore beginners who post a hundreds lines of code and asking why is it not working. Or even worse just asking for homework to be done. So yeah, they better GTFO from SO.
