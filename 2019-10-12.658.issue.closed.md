They said if a man wants to learn programming(or do anything else), he MUST posts photos wearing skirts to show everyone. Sounds strange, but really funny

@mayeths you used pronoun _he_ as a generic and didn't consider that women also can want to learn how to use git! Please use 's/he' or 'they' instead!

Edit: haven't noticed that you are foreign, sorry for being a dick, but this is a serious issue to not have respect for women nowadays! Otherwise when pissed-off womankind will rule the world, history will remember you as a sexist. Do you want that to happen?

Wait, it confused me even more. Originally on Chinese was it  about *anyone* or only about *males*? Because if it was about *anyone*, this would be correct:

>They said if anyone wants to learn programming(or do anything else), **they** MUST posts photos wearing skirts to show everyone. Sounds strange, but really funny

But if was about *males*, your current edit is right if you didn't use the word *man* in its old meaning because in English, historically, in scientific communities the word *man* was used to identify human-beings in general, so if you used it in that meaning, it still sounds like you are sexist, and the word *human* would be more suitable. However, if you will use word human but don't change pronoun *he* it would be like, only males could be humans. 

Btw, I was just kidding, nobody takes a shit about women rights because we all know the rule 37 of the internet which says that they do not exist.

Nop, it's just my mistake, but we use "HE" to indicate a unknown person. We have„Äå‰ªñÔºåÂ•πÔºåÂÆÉ„Äçto indicate HE, SHE and IT, all of them pronounce "TA" -- which means you may be confused when someone say "TA". We always guess "s/he" from the context and it's not that difficult. For convenience, our ancestors use ‰ªñ (HE, also "TA") to refer to a specific but unidentified person. This's why I misuse "anyone" and "he".

Wow, if it really is how I imagine it, there is a plenty background for ambiguous lexical jokes, like referring to somebody as "TA" like: "TA looks great today!" and after person respond to you, you just like "Oh, did you think I meant *TA*? I was talking about a flower over here)0))", that's cool (I'm 5 yo btw)!  I'm not familiar with any Asian languages and for me it's all looks like sticks with cute patterns (no offense).  

Comparing to many European languages, English is pretty neutral with [grammatical gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender#English), but we don't have 3rd person (he/she/it) neutral pronoun, so we often use [singular-they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_pronoun#Singular_they) instead: "Everyone _has_ to take off _their_ gloves before _they_ can have right to speak." I emphasized 'has' because 'everyone' considered to be singular as well, and when I used 'they' it had meaning of 3rd person pronoun, hence it can be substituted as 'he/she(/it)' ('their' -> 'his/her(/its)')

The writing below may contain misspells or grammar errors, please let me apologize for my poor English beforehand.

@b00sher please allow me to correct a mistake in @mayeths 's explanation:
Chinese, or to be precise, Han characters, are Logosyllabic scripts([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram)). The character '‰ªñ' contains two parts, '‰∫ª' and '‰πü'. '‰∫ª' means human, and '‰πü' indicates that it's a third-person pronoun. Thus, '‰ªñ' is gender-neutral in the first place, not as @mayeths says about our ancestors seeking convenience. But there's a women-right movement back in 1920 that create the character 'Â•π' to specify the pronoun for a third-person woman. Since then and only since then, '‰ªñ' slowly becoming the pronoun for third-person man. 
Nowadays, the official dictionary of Han characters still explains the character '‰ªñ' as a gender-neutral pronoun for a third-person human.

I know this is some kind of wording, but it never hurt to learn some new things tho :p

@Slept-Warrior thank you for the explanation. Wonder, why did they make another character but keep pronunciation? For instance, in Spanish there are 2 ways to say "they": "ellos/ellas", we use "ellos" when we don't know about about gender of a group members, and "ellas" when we are talking about a group of females.  

I'm not a native English speaker, there is nothing for you to apologize for, your English is pretty.

@b00sher Sorry for the delay, was kinda busy lately.
Now about the thing you wondered: 
The pronunciation of a Chinese character is formed by an initial, an vowel and a tone. In Mandarin Chinese, there are 23 initials, 24 vowels and 4 tones, if you ignore that some initial and vowel can't combine, there will be 23*24*4 (2208) type of pronunciation only for a Chinese word. I guess it's the limitation that caused the pronoun pronunciation problem.

And some relevant fun fact: 
In some part of China people use different pronoun (with slightly different pronunciation) if they want to address someone respectfully. In those circumstances they use ÊÇ® (nin) instead of ‰Ω† (ni) when they talk about the second-person 'you', they use ÊÄπ (tan) instead of ‰ªñ (ta) for the third person
