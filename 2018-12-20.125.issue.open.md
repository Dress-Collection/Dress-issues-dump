How does GPL apply to images?

I think Creative Commons better than GPL for this. Isn't it? You are right.

@FrankHB I think GitHub did a good job summarizing and it still somewhat makes sense for images:

@Mouse0w0 Good point. And since changing the license would require permission from all contributors, it should be done sooner rather than later (if @komeiji-satori thinks this is a good idea)

@a-wing Your images are and will continue to be licensed under GPL, unless otherwise specified. To my knowledge, you could add a license file to your directory to specify what other can and can't do with your work.

@ApolloZhu The guidelines on GitHub are not sufficient. Read the legal text please.

Many licenses clearly state which works will be applicable, like "software" or "programs" for example. They often distinguish "source" form other forms in the covered work as well. GPLv3 falls in this category, as it explicitly offers the rights of "conveying verbatim copies (of the Program's source code)", "conveying modified source versions" and "conveying non-source forms" in different conditions. Because of the conditions, there is no permission granted for non-program materials automatically, so even the verbatim copy could be illegal (depending on laws and the jurisdiction). Despite that, it is also impossible to satisfy the conditions for photographs because there is no source form of them can be provided, but the requirements do not vanish for this reason.

We could argue that The Program in this case would be the images and source code would be the binary representation, or both the work and source code are the images.

But anyways, you are right about GPL is not a very good choice for images

This definition is not complete. The original sentence is:

>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

The complement here is not ignorable. As "this License" is well-defined, and the conditions of the license are listed clearly, the extent of "copyrightable work" is not solely depends on the copyright law which defines the universe of "copyrightable work" in general, but also the status of whether the work is licensable according to the law. There may be other more generic laws considered as well, e.g. contract laws and tort laws. It highly depends.

We all agree a change is needed :-)

So I've created a PR to change the license to CC BY SA NC. Consider merging it if you all agree to change to CC BY SA NC.

In my option. I prefer change it to mit or apache.

Well, it is said on https://choosealicense.com/non-software/ that:
_CC0-1.0, CC-BY-4.0, and CC-BY-SA-4.0 are open licenses used for non-software material ranging from datasets to videos_
The current license "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0" sounds a reasonable choice, just one question:
If these photos are shared to other places, will you guys want these photos to be addressed to you?
