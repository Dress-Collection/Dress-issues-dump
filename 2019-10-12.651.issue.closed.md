Why do Chinese people like to post some irrelevant stuff on Github? This is really disappointing.

Infact, this is a project that encourage more people to learn and understand, to know the ideology of githubã€‚There's a tutorial that teach quasi-programmer and non-programmer (but who collaborate to create projects)  to use github. So them used a simple and amiable example (to teach): upload your picture. Just like what you do on some other software and platform. So this aroused a lot of interest. They start to learn and know the way of github: branch, pull requests, merge, fork. For example: to add a feauture u need to fork and operate the branch, pull req of bad "code" will not be accepted, and so on.
