Well... We do appreciate the efforts but when translating something an important point is that the original meaning, whether represented by the words directly or expressed somehow by the using of words should be kept as-is, which cannot be achieved w/o an clear and complete understanding of the context and certain larger circumstances. It is not that the translation was wrong but lack of contextual understanding can be seen from changed words. Not willing to explain it here it is no easy work. Still I do believe that any respond to the thread shall be present. Btw I'd like to know where did you find this GitHub repository?

Also keep in mind that my reply does not reflect any "official" opinion of the project (and its owner and co-owners) and suggests not the reason of the ignorance: maybe the stuff members are simply too tired to read any English.

I found it via my GitHub feed (I guess one of the people I'm following starred it), and was curious. I'm not trying to start drama, if you're referring to the difference between "cross-dressing" and "wearing women's clothing" my thought was that the literal Chinese seems to be closer to the idea of wearing women's clothing rather than the idea of cross-dressing. But I understand that the original intent might have been the idea of "cross dressing". 

Obviously the above is a trickier issue, but the (added rather than changed) translations of the instructions might still be useful. 

Anyway just practicing my GitHub and translation :)

Well... If those with write permission are interested in globalization of the project. I guess not.

Whatever. Thanks. Meeting you and having the opportunity of chatting here with you is already a joyful experience. From your reply is it suggested that you can speak Chinese? (Maybe this is not a good chatroom)

Regarding "cross-dressing" vs "wearing womens' clothing": the former implies that the wearer is not female, but the contributing guidelines state that there is no restriction on gender.
